        description: 'As a matter of fact, the red blood cells of our body carry a certain amount of oxygen. The oxygen level in our body signifies the amount of oxygen we are currently having in our blood. High oxygenation in the blood is mandatorily needed as it plays a very important role in so many functionalities. On the other hand, decreased amount of oxygen in the blood may give birth to so many kinds of physical complexions that may turn really hard to be treated at some points. \n The amount of oxygen that your blood cells carry compared to their complete capacity can be considered as your oxygen saturation. Undoubtedly, there lies the basic importance of using a pulse oximeter as that can help you get the exact oxygen saturation levels displayed. The oxygen level is also measured based on the percentage of oxygenated and non-oxygenated hemoglobins. If your blood cells are carrying 5% of non-oxygenated and 95% of oxygenated hemoglobin, then your SPo2 value is 95%. This is how to get the exact oxygen levels measured. \n There are so many types of activities that may impact your oxygen saturation and give birth to many critical physical problems. Undoubtedly, unhealthy habits like smoking is one of them. People who are having SPo2 values under 90 percent may face critical physical complexions like shortness of breath and irregular heart rates. Besides, frequent breathing difficulty and all types of respiratory illness is also very common if you are having a lower SPO2 level than normal. There lies the exact necessity of rapid monitoring. Purchase a pulse oximeter today to get your oxygen levels monitored in a proper manner or consult a medical expert today to fetch more necessary information in this regard.'
